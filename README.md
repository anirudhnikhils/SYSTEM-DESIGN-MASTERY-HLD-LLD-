🚀 System Design Mastery – HLD + LLD + Real-World Architectures

This repository is a complete roadmap for mastering High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) required for top-tier backend engineering, platform engineering, cloud, and system architecture roles.

The content is structured phase-wise, covering fundamentals → scalable architectures → advanced distributed components → detailed LLD patterns.
